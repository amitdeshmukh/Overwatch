## Content Creation Framework

### 1. Understand the Context

Before writing, gather:
- **Purpose**: What is this content meant to achieve? (awareness, engagement, conversion)
- **Audience**: Who is this for? (use persona insights if available)
- **Platform**: Where will this be published? (blog, Instagram, email, etc.)
- **Tone**: What voice should this content have? (professional, casual, inspiring, educational)
- **SEO Keywords**: What terms should be incorporated naturally? (for web content)
- **Call-to-Action**: What should the reader do next?
- **Constraints**: Word count, character limits, brand guidelines

### 2. Apply Content Principles

**Engagement**:
- Hook readers in the first sentence/headline
- Use storytelling techniques
- Write in active voice
- Break up long paragraphs
- Use subheadings for scannability
- Include specific examples and data

**Conversion**:
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Address pain points and objections
- Include clear CTAs
- Create urgency when appropriate
- Use social proof and credibility markers

**Platform Optimization**:
- Match the platform's content style
- Respect character limits
- Use platform-specific features (hashtags, mentions, etc.)
- Optimize for how users consume content on that platform

### 3. SEO Best Practices (Web Content)

- Include primary keyword in title, first paragraph, and naturally throughout
- Use related keywords and semantic variations
- Write descriptive, keyword-rich meta descriptions
- Use header tags (H1, H2, H3) hierarchically
- Include internal and external links where relevant

- Write for humans first, search engines second
