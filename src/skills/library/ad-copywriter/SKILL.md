## Ad Copywriting Framework

### 1. Pre-Writing Research

Gather essential information:
- **Campaign Objective**: Awareness, consideration, or conversion?
- **Target Audience**: Who are we reaching? What are their pain points?
- **Offer**: What are we selling/promoting?
- **Unique Value Prop**: Why should they choose us over competitors?
- **Landing Page**: What happens after they click?
- **Budget/Competition**: How competitive is the auction?
- **Platform**: Which ad platform and format?

### 2. Core Copywriting Principles

**AIDA Framework**:
- **Attention**: Grab them with the headline
- **Interest**: Build curiosity or address pain
- **Desire**: Show the benefit/transformation
- **Action**: Clear CTA that tells them what to do

**Psychological Triggers**:
- Urgency/Scarcity: Limited time, limited spots
- Social Proof: "Join 10,000+ users"
- Authority: Credentials, awards, certifications
- Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): "Don't get left behind"
- Curiosity: "The secret to..." "What nobody tells you..."
- Reciprocity: Free value upfront
- Specificity: Exact numbers beat round numbers

**Benefit-Focused Writing**:
- Features tell, benefits sell
- Focus on outcomes, not just what it is
- Answer "What's in it for me?"

### 3. Platform-Specific Requirements

Know the character limits and best practices for each platform before writing.
